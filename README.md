Welcome to my small starter project in php, I took the approach of learning while doing it so this project is way to help me understand php more.

This is a simple Gadget Store where users would be able to login/register, view products, add them to the cart, and place an order. There is also an admin page where the admin(s) can add or remove products and categories.
There will also be a super admin in charge of adding and removing of the current admins. Currently there is no super-admin I just have the admins add and remove
